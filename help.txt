this program requires autohotkey, but the folder can be put anywhere

the script will only be active when roblox is active, and only be functional when f5 is pressed upon entering a game

you will need to have q set as 'open build menu' and e set as 'exit build menu'

adding a shortcut to the app file is recommended
this can be done by right clicking and adding a shortcut, then dragging this shortcut to the windows startup location
the startup folder is located at
'C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup'

once everything has been setup, join a tc3 game, hit f5, and then hit ctrl-z on the power plant icon
now when you press z, the power plant should get quickly put onto your cursor, and saving with ctrl-z will then be unnecessary
